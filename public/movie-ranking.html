<h4> It happened one night</h4>
<p> 
   This is an insanely good movie it has all you need: <br />
   - Romance <br /> 
   - Mystery <br /> 
   - Strangers falling in love over the course of three days.
</p>

<h4> Lion King Two  </h4>
<p> 
  
   The Love Story between Kovu and Kiarra is amazing for many reasons: <br /> 
   <ul>
       <li>The enemies to lover trope </li>
       <li>The suspense of if Kovu's love is genuine or if he is going to betray her<br /> </li>
       <li>The musical element of the movie, "Upendi" is quite possibly one of the best songs ever</li>

   
</ul>
</p>

<h4> The Holiday </h4>
<p> 
   The switched lifestyle movie is amazing: <br /> 
   - The score is to die for! <br /> 
   - The Jack Black character is so loveble <br />
